# Proxy Pattern

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform
something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

The proxy object has the same interface as a service,
which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.
