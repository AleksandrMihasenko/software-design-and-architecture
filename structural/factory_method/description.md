# Factory Method Pattern

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves
the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory method pattern provides an interface for creating objects that can be modified after creation.
The logic for creating our objects is centralized in a single place, simplifying and better organizing our code.
