# Layered Pattern

This pattern is based on dividing the application into logical layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility
and interacts with the layers above and below it.

This pattern can be used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks,
each of which is at a particular level of abstraction. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer.

The most commonly found 4 layers of a general information system are as follows.
* Presentation layer (also known as UI layer)
* Application layer (also known as service layer)
* Business logic layer (also known as domain layer)
* Data access layer (also known as persistence layer)

### Usage
* General desktop applications
* E-commerce web applications
