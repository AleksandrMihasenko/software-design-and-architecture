# Command-Query Responsibility Segregation Architecture (CQRS) Pattern

This pattern separates the command and query responsibilities of an application's model, making it easier to scale
and optimize the application. The command side handles creating, updating, and deleting operations,
while the query side handles queries. This can significantly improve performance, simplicity, and scalability.
