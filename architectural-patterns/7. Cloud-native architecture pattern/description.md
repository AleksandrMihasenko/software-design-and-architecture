# Cloud-native Architecture Pattern

This is a pattern where applications are developed and deployed to run on cloud platforms, leveraging cloud services,
and infrastructure for scalability, reliability, and agility. It's characterized by containerizing services,
allowing for maximum portability and resilience; microservices, a design that separates functionality into modular components;
orchestration, managing these containers and services; and declarative APIs, which express the systemâ€™s desired state.
