# Event Bus Pattern

The Interpreter Pattern is a design pattern that falls under the category of behavioral patterns.
It is used to define the grammar for interpreting a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in that language.
This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with languages or grammars, and it is often applied in the development of compilers,
interpreters, and similar language-processing systems.

Here are the key components and concepts associated with the Interpreter Pattern:

1. Abstract Expression: Defines an interface for interpreting a particular context.
It typically consists of an interpret method that takes a context as an argument and performs the interpretation.

2. Terminal Expression: Implements the abstract expression interface for terminal symbols in the grammar.
These are the basic building blocks of the language and do not require further interpretation.

3. Non-terminal Expression: Implements the abstract expression interface for non-terminal symbols in the grammar.
Non-terminal expressions may consist of one or more terminal or non-terminal expressions, forming a hierarchical structure.

4. Context: Contains information that is being interpreted. It is often passed to the interpreter for evaluation.

5. Client: Builds the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the language and invokes the interpreter to interpret the AST.
