# Layered Pattern

This pattern can be used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks,
each of which is at a particular level of abstraction. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer.

The most commonly found 4 layers of a general information system are as follows.
* Presentation layer (also known as UI layer)
* Application layer (also known as service layer)
* Business logic layer (also known as domain layer)
* Data access layer (also known as persistence layer)

### Usage
* General desktop applications
* E-commerce web applications
