# Space-based Architecture Pattern

Space-based Architecture pattern is a software design method that centers the system's structure around the idea of "spaces" -
independent and autonomous units. High-volume distributed systems often use it to overcome data bottlenecks,
network latency, and grid failure. It divides the processing and storage between multiple servers,
eliminating the need for a central server and, thus, the problem of a single point of failure.
