# Domain Driven Design

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development philosophy centered around the domain,
or sphere of knowledge, of those that use it. The approach enables the development of software
that is focused on the complex requirements of those that need it and doesn’t waste effort on anything unneeded.
The clients of domain-driven design are often enterprise-level businesses.

## Key concepts and terms associated with Domain-Driven Design:
1. Domain: The subject area or problem space to which the software is being applied.
It's the specific sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application revolves.

2. Model: A representation of the real-world concepts in the problem domain and the relationships between them.
In DDD, the model is a central part of the design process and should be shared and understood by both technical
and non-technical team members.

3. Ubiquitous Language: A common, shared language used by all team members (developers, stakeholders, domain experts)
to discuss the domain and the software system. It helps bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical individuals.

4. Bounded Context: Defines the explicit boundaries within which a particular model or term is defined and applicable.
Different parts of a system may use the same term, but with different meanings, based on the context.
Bounded contexts help avoid confusion.

5. Entities: Objects within the domain that have a distinct identity and can change over time.
For example, in an e-commerce system, a "Product" might be an entity.

6. Value Objects: Objects without an identity; they are defined by their attributes.
They are immutable and represent concepts in the domain that are not distinct by identity.
For instance, a "Price" or a "Color" could be a value object.

7. Aggregates: Clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit.
They have a defined boundary and are updated and persisted together.
Aggregates help maintain consistency and encapsulate business rules.

8. Repositories: Responsible for accessing and persisting aggregates.
They provide a way to store and retrieve domain objects without exposing the underlying data storage details.

9. Services: Operations or actions that don’t naturally fit into the concept of an entity or value object.
Services are used to model domain logic that doesn’t naturally belong to a specific object.

10. Domain Events: Represent significant changes or occurrences within the domain.
They are used to communicate changes and trigger actions in other parts of the system.
