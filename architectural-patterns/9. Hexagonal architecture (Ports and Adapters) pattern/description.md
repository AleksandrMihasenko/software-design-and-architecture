# Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) Pattern

This pattern separates the application into an inner and outer layer, where the inner layer contains the business logic
and the outer layer includes the interfaces with the outside world. It allows an application to equally be driven by users,
programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.
