# Microkernel Architecture (plug-in architecture) Pattern

This is an approach where the kernel provides minimal functionality, and services are implemented as separate modules
outside the kernel (plug-ins). This separation allows developers to add, modify, or remove system components
without impacting the core system functionality.
