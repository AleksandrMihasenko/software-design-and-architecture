# Event Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a system design practice built to record, transmit, and process events through
a decoupled architecture. This means that systems don't need to know about each other to share information and accomplish tasks.

Decoupling is a key advantage of EDA over other data-sharing methods like APIs.
With APIs, applications need to know dependencies and parameters, send a properly formatted request, and wait for a response.
This creates a request-response model for data transfer.

## Use cases:

* Data replication: One event can be shared between multiple services that need to copy its data into their databases.
* Parallel processing: Multiple processes can be triggered by one event to execute asynchronously of each other.
* Real-time monitoring: Systems can generate events for changes to their state so an organization can scan for anomalies and suspicious activities.
* Interoperability: Events can be persisted and propagated regardless of the code services are written in.
* Redundancy: If a service is down, events can be persisted in the router until the service is available to consume the event.
* Microservices: EDA is commonly paired with microservices to efficiently share information between decoupled systems at scale.
