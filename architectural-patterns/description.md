# Architectural Pattern

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
Architectural patterns are similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope.

Software design defines a software system's architecture, components, modules, and interfaces to meet specified requirements.
During the software design phase, we create a high-level view of the system, including its structure, behavior,
and interactions with other systems. This involves making decisions about the software's internal structure and organization.

We identified some architectural styles and patterns in different categories based on a view of them:

## By Connections - a way how to connect devices and applications.

1. REST (Representational State Transfer)
2. BFF (Backend for Frontend)
3. RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
4. P2P (Peer to Peer)
5. SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

## By Composition - how we compose internal structures.

1. Microservices
2. Monolith
3. Microkernel
4. Layers
5. Plugins
6. Components

## Nano services

1. By Events - use it to decouple software components in an event-driven manner.
2. Publish/Subscribe
3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
4. ES (Event Sourcing)
5. Reactive
6. By Stream - how data flow through our system.
7. Pipe and Filters
8. Message Brokers
9. Fast Data

## By Data - for data-oriented systems.

1. Data Mesh
2. Data Warehouse
3. Data Fabric
4. Data-centric Business Logic
5. Data Lake
6. By Purpose

## API Platform

1. Integration Hub
2. Developer Portal
3. Developer Platform
