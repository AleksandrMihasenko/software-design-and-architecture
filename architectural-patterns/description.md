# Architectural Pattern

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
Architectural patterns are similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope.

Software design defines a software system's architecture, components, modules, and interfaces to meet specified requirements.
During the software design phase, we create a high-level view of the system, including its structure, behavior,
and interactions with other systems. This involves making decisions about the software's internal structure and organization.
