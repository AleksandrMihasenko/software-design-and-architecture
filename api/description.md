# Communication Between Client and Server

Communication between the client and server typically involves sending requests from the client to the server and receiving
responses in return. This communication can occur over various protocols, each suited to different requirements.

HTTP serves as the foundation for web communication, while APIs like REST, SOAP, gRPC, and GraphQL provide structured ways
for clients to interact with servers, each with its own strengths and use cases.

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It's a stateless protocol, meaning each request
from the client to the server is independent. HTTP operates over TCP/IP and defines how messages are formatted and transmitted,
and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

## API (Application Programming Interface):
An API allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods
and data structures that developers can use to access functionality provided by a service or library.

Common types of APIs include:

1. REST (Representational State Transfer)
2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
3. RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
4. Websockets
5. GraphQL
