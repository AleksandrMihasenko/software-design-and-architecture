# Builder Pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesnâ€™t require products to have a common interface.
That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.

Using the builder pattern, we can create an object and apply to it only the "steps" we need, which is a more flexible approach.
